Thought 1: Thought 1: Thought 1: Since the travelers are starting from Milwaukee and want to visit two cities in Michigan, I should first identify suitable cities in Michigan to visit.
Action 1: Action 1: CitySearch[Michigan]
Observation 1: ['Pellston', 'Traverse City', 'Alpena', 'Iron Mountain', 'Kalamazoo', 'Saginaw', 'Grand Rapids', 'Lansing', 'Muskegon', 'Hancock', 'Detroit', 'Escanaba']

Thought 2: Thought 2: Thought 2: I should select two popular cities in Michigan that offer attractions, dining, and suitable accommodations. Detroit and Grand Rapids are both well-known and have diverse options, making them good choices for the itinerary. Next, I need to estimate the travel distance and time from Milwaukee to Detroit by car, since flights are not preferred.
Action 2: Action 2: GoogleDistanceMatrix[Milwaukee, Detroit, self-driving]
Observation 2: self-driving, from Milwaukee to Detroit, duration: 5 hours 40 mins, distance: 614 km, cost: 30

Thought 3: Thought 3: Thought 3: Now that I have the travel details from Milwaukee to Detroit, I should store this information in the Notebook for the Planner to use later.
Action 3: Action 3: NotebookWrite[Driving distance, time, and cost from Milwaukee to Detroit]
Observation 3: The information has been recorded in Notebook, and its index is 0.

Thought 4: Thought 4: Thought 4: After reaching Detroit, the travelers will need accommodation that allows parties and provides private rooms. I should search for accommodations in Detroit next.

Thought 5: Thought 5: Thought 5: I need to identify accommodations in Detroit that allow parties and provide private rooms. From the search results, none explicitly state that parties are allowed; most have "No parties" in the house rules. I should still store the available options in the Notebook for reference, and then check Grand Rapids for better options.

Thought 7: Thought 7: Thought 7: From the Grand Rapids accommodation results, most listings do not allow parties, but there is one called "Sunny Ditmas Park Carriage House (Events Listing)" which may be suitable for events. I should store these options in the Notebook for the Planner to review and select the best fit.
