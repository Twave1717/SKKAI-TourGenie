**Budget Calculation (approximate, for 5 people):**  
- Transportation: $22 (La Crosse–Chicago) + $10 (Chicago–Champaign) + $7 (Champaign–Peoria) = $39  
- Accommodation:  
  - Chicago: $109 x 3 nights = $327

  - Peoria: $219 x 1 night = $219  
  - Total Accommodation: $1,838  
- Meals: Estimate $30/person/day x 5 people x 7 days = $1,050  
- Attractions: Many are free or low-cost; estimate $20/person/day x 5 people x 7 days = $700  
- Total Estimated: $39 (transport) + $1,838 (accommodation) + $1,050 (meals) + $700 (attractions) = $3,627
