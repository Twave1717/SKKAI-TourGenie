Thought 1: Thought 1: Since the travelers are starting from Milwaukee and want to visit two cities in Michigan, I should first identify suitable cities in Michigan to visit.
Action 1: CitySearch[Michigan]
Observation 1: ['Pellston', 'Traverse City', 'Alpena', 'Iron Mountain', 'Kalamazoo', 'Saginaw', 'Grand Rapids', 'Lansing', 'Muskegon', 'Hancock', 'Detroit', 'Escanaba']
Thought 2: Thought 2: I should select two popular cities in Michigan that offer attractions, dining, and suitable accommodations. Detroit and Grand Rapids are both well-known and have diverse options, making them good choices for the itinerary. Next, I need to estimate the travel distance and time from Milwaukee to Detroit by car, since flights are not preferred.
