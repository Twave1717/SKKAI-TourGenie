Thought 1: Thought 1: Since the trip is from Asheville to Minneapolis, I should first search for available flights on March 7th, 2022.
Action 1: Action 1: FlightSearch[Asheville, Minneapolis, 2022-03-07]
Observation 1: There is no flight from Asheville to Minneapolis on 2022-03-07.

Thought 2: Thought 2: Since there are no direct flights from Asheville to Minneapolis on the desired date, I should check the driving distance, time, and cost between Asheville and Minneapolis as an alternative transportation option.
Action 2: Action 2: GoogleDistanceMatrix[Asheville, Minneapolis, self-driving]
Observation 2: self-driving, from Asheville to Minneapolis, duration: 15 hours 47 mins, distance: 1,711 km, cost: 85

Thought 3: Thought 3: Since I have obtained the self-driving information, I need to write this data into the Notebook for the Planner to use later.
