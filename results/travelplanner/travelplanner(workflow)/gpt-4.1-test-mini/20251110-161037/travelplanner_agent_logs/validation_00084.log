Thought 2: Thought 2: Thought 2: Among the cities listed, Houston, San Antonio, Austin, and Dallas are major travel destinations with plenty of attractions, dining, and accommodation options. I will select Austin and San Antonio for a diverse experience, as they are relatively close and offer unique cultural and entertainment opportunities. Next, I need to check flight options from Salt Lake City to Austin for March 14th, 2022.
