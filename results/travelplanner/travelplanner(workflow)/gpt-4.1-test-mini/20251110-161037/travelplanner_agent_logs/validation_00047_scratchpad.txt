**Budget Breakdown (approximate, for 7 people):**  
- Transportation (self-driving): $20 + $5 + $13 + $22 = $60  
- Accommodation:  
  - Richmond: $796 x 2 nights = $1,592  
  - Charlottesville: $1,094 x 2 nights = $2,188  
  - Norfolk: $1,190 x 2 nights = $2,380  
  - **However, this exceeds the budget. To stay within $2,900, adjust as follows:**  
    - In Richmond, book 1 Inviting Brooklyn Studio ($398/night, max 5) + 1 Bright Spacious BK Room with Bath ($204/night, max 1) + 1 Centrally Located Beautiful Escape ($828/night, max 5, but only 1 night allowed). Instead, use Inviting Brooklyn Studio ($398) + East Village 1BR with private patio ($566, max 4) for 2 nights: $398 + $566 = $964/night x 2 = $1,928.  
    - In Charlottesville, use One bedroom apartment ($176/night, max 5) + Single room in Bushwick w/backyard ($107/night, max 2): $176 + $107 = $283/night x 2 = $566.  
    - In Norfolk, use Large studio all to yourself ($393/night, max 3) + Airports Sleep Inn ($697/night, max 4): $393 + $697 = $1,090/night x 2 = $2,180.  
    - **But still over budget. Therefore, prioritize lowest cost, even if group splits:**  
      - Richmond: Inviting Brooklyn Studio ($398, 5) + Bright Spacious BK Room with Bath ($204, 1) + Spacious Room with Character in BK ($1,032, 3) – but only 1 night min for the $1,032 room.  
      - Charlottesville: One bedroom apartment ($176, 5) + Single room in Bushwick w/backyard ($107, 2)  
      - Norfolk: Large studio all to yourself ($393, 2) + Airports Sleep Inn ($697, 4) + Hudson Yard - Lux King Room ($1,066, 1)  
    - **For this plan, let's use the lowest cost, splitting group as needed.**

**Final Budgeted Accommodation Plan:**  
- Richmond (2 nights): Inviting Brooklyn Studio ($398, 5) + Bright Spacious BK Room with Bath ($204, 1) + Spacious Room with Character in BK ($1,032, 3)  
  - But max occupancy is 9, so book Inviting Brooklyn Studio ($398, 5) + East Village 1BR with private patio ($566, 4) = $964/night x 2 = $1,928  
- Charlottesville (2 nights): One bedroom apartment ($176, 5) + Single room in Bushwick w/backyard ($107, 2) = $283/night x 2 = $566  
- Norfolk (2 nights): Large studio all to yourself ($393, 2) + Airports Sleep Inn ($697, 4) + Hudson Yard - Lux King Room ($1,066, 1) = $2,156/night x 2 = $4,312 (over budget)  
- **Therefore, reduce Norfolk to Large studio all to yourself ($393, 2) + Airports Sleep Inn ($697, 4) = $1,090/night x 2 = $2,180**  
- **Total for 6 nights: $1,928 + $566 + $2,180 = $4,674**  
- **This is over budget. To stay within $2,900, group must book only the lowest cost rooms and possibly reduce occupancy or nights.**

**Therefore, for a $2,900 budget, the group must:**
- Book only the lowest cost rooms, splitting group as needed.
- Limit restaurant spending to $10-15/person/meal.
- Possibly reduce the number of nights or group size.

**Sample Plan (with lowest cost accommodation, group split):**

Day 1: March 2, 2022  
Current City: from Philadelphia to Richmond  
Transportation: Self-driving, $20  
Breakfast: -  
Attraction: Virginia Museum of Fine Arts  
Lunch: Defence Bakery  
Attraction: Maymont  
Dinner: Number 31  
Accommodation: Inviting Brooklyn Studio ($398, 5) + Bright Spacious BK Room with Bath ($204, 1) + Spacious Room with Character in BK ($1032, 3) – but only 1 night min for $1032 room.  
**But to stay within budget, book Inviting Brooklyn Studio ($398, 5) + East Village 1BR with private patio ($566, 4) = $964/night**

Day 2: March 3, 2022  
Current City: Richmond  
Accommodation: Inviting Brooklyn Studio + East Village 1BR with private patio ($964/night)

Day 3: March 4, 2022  
Current City: from Richmond to Charlottesville  
Transportation: Self-driving, $5  
Accommodation: One bedroom apartment ($176, 5) + Single room in Bushwick w/backyard ($107, 2) = $283/night

Day 4: March 5, 2022  
Current City: Charlottesville  
Accommodation: One bedroom apartment + Single room in Bushwick w/backyard ($283/night)

Day 5: March 6, 2022  
Current City: from Charlottesville to Norfolk  
Transportation: Self-driving, $13  
Accommodation: Large studio all to yourself ($393, 2) + Airports Sleep Inn ($697, 4) = $1,090/night

Day 6: March 7, 2022  
Current City: Norfolk  
Accommodation: Large studio all to yourself + Airports Sleep Inn ($1,090/night)

Day 7: March 8, 2022  
Current City: from Norfolk to Philadelphia  
Transportation: Self-driving, $22  
Accommodation: -

**Total Accommodation Cost:**  
Richmond: $964 x 2 = $1,928  
Charlottesville: $283 x 2 = $566  
Norfolk: $1,090 x 2 = $2,180  
**Total: $4,674 (over budget)**

**Conclusion:**  
Given the accommodation prices, it is not possible to accommodate 7 people for 6 nights in these cities within a $2,900 budget using the provided options.  
**If the group is reduced to 5 people, or if only 1 night is spent in each city, the budget may be feasible.**  
**Alternatively, if the group is willing to split and use private rooms, the lowest cost per night is:**

- Richmond: Inviting Brooklyn Studio ($398, 5) + Bright Spacious BK Room with Bath ($204, 1) + Centrally Located Beautiful Escape ($828, 5, but only 1 night allowed)  
- Charlottesville: One bedroom apartment ($176, 5) + Single room in Bushwick w/backyard ($107, 2)  
- Norfolk: Large studio all to yourself ($393, 2) + Airports Sleep Inn ($697, 4)

**For the purpose of this plan, I will proceed with the above split, and note that the budget will be exceeded due to high accommodation costs.**
