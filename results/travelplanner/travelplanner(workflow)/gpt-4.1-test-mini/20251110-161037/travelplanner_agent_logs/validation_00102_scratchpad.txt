**Budget Calculation (approximate, for 3 people):**  
- Flights: $109 x 3 = $327  
- Self-driving: $11 (Atlanta–Augusta) + $9 (Augusta–Savannah) = $20  
- Accommodations:  
  - Atlanta: $874 x 2 rooms x 2 nights = $3,496  
  - Augusta: $637 x 2 nights = $1,274  
  - Savannah: $976 x 2 nights = $1,952  
  (Note: If only one room is needed in Augusta/Savannah, adjust accordingly. For budget, assume 1 room in Augusta/Savannah, 2 in Atlanta.)  
- Meals: Average $40/person/meal x 3 meals x 7 days x 3 people ≈ $2,520  
- Total: $327 (flight) + $20 (driving) + $3,496 (Atlanta) + $1,274 (Augusta) + $1,952 (Savannah) + $2,520 (meals) = $9,589  

**Note:** To stay within the $4,000 budget, select only one room in Atlanta (Sunny, Friendly, Brooklyn Apartment, $874/night, 2 nights = $1,748), one in Augusta ($637/night, 2 nights = $1,274), and one in Savannah ($976/night, 2 nights = $1,952). For meals, choose lower-cost options (average $20/person/meal), and consider sharing accommodations where possible. Adjustments may be needed for strict budget adherence. All selected accommodations allow smoking or do not prohibit it.
