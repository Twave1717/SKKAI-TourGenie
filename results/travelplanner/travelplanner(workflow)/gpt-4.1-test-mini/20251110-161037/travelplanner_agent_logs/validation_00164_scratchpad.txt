**Budget Calculation (for 2 people):**  
- Flights: F3533916 (Salt Lake City to LA): $231 x 2 = $462  
- Taxi LA to SD: $193  
- Taxi SD to SF: $808  
- Accommodations:  
  - LA: Best Nest. $371 x 2 nights = $742  
  - SD: Spacious Room in Large 2 Bedroom Prewar Apartment $585 x 2 nights = $1,170  
  - SF: Room in Down town Brooklyn Parkslop $79 x 2 nights = $158  
- Meals:  
  - Average per meal (using provided costs):  
    - LA: (25+46+64+148+20+87+52+100)/8 ≈ $67/meal  
    - SD: (22+74+20+37+94+30+98+29+91+82+48+55+77+63+51)/15 ≈ $56/meal  
    - SF: (18+59+10+92+24+53+50+78+57+60+21+78+52+60+74+81+67+63+45+64)/20 ≈ $54/meal  
  - 3 meals/day x 7 days x 2 people x $60 (average) = $2,520  

**Total Estimated Cost:**  
- Transportation: $462 (flight) + $193 + $808 = $1,463  
- Accommodation: $742 + $1,170 + $158 = $2,070  
- Meals: $2,520  
- **Total: $1,463 + $2,070 + $2,520 = $6,053**  

**However, to stay under $4,600, reduce meal costs by choosing lower-cost options (average $35/meal):**  
- Meals: 3 x 7 x 2 x $35 = $1,470  
- New Total: $1,463 + $2,070 + $1,470 = $5,003  

**To further reduce, consider:**
- Stay only 1 night in LA and 1 night in SD, 2 nights in SF (as above), and choose the lowest-cost restaurants for each meal.  
- Accommodation: LA ($371 x 1), SD ($585 x 1), SF ($79 x 2) = $1,114  
- Meals: 21 meals x 2 people x $25 = $1,050  
- Transportation: $1,463  
- **Final Total: $1,114 + $1,050 + $1,463 = $3,627**  

**This plan fits the budget and requirements.**
