Thought 25: Thought 25: Thought 25: I should store the restaurant information for Savannah in the Notebook so the Planner can use it to suggest dining options for the group.
Action 25: Action 25: NotebookWrite[Restaurants in Savannah]
Observation 25: The information has been recorded in Notebook, and its index is 11.

Thought 26: Thought 26: Thought 26: I have now collected information on flights, accommodations, attractions, and restaurants for Atlanta, Augusta, and Savannah, as well as self-driving transportation options between the cities. This should be sufficient for the Planner to create a detailed 7-day itinerary within the $4,000 budget, prioritizing accommodations with smoking areas where possible.
Action 26: Action 26: Planner[Create a 7-day travel plan for a group of 3, departing from Greensboro and touring Atlanta, Augusta, and Savannah in Georgia from March 10th to March 16th, 2022. The plan should include transportation, accommodation (prioritizing smoking areas if available), dining, and attractions, and stay within a $4,000 budget.]

**Budget Calculation (approximate, for 3 people):**  
- Flights: $109 x 3 = $327  
- Self-driving: $11 (Atlanta–Augusta) + $9 (Augusta–Savannah) = $20  
- Accommodations:  
  - Atlanta: $874 x 2 rooms x 2 nights = $3,496  
  - Augusta: $637 x 2 nights = $1,274  
  - Savannah: $976 x 2 nights = $1,952  
  (Note: If only one room is needed in Augusta/Savannah, adjust accordingly. For budget, assume 1 room in Augusta/Savannah, 2 in Atlanta.)  
- Meals: Average $40/person/meal x 3 meals x 7 days x 3 people ≈ $2,520  
- Total: $327 (flight) + $20 (driving) + $3,496 (Atlanta) + $1,274 (Augusta) + $1,952 (Savannah) + $2,520 (meals) = $9,589  

**Note:** To stay within the $4,000 budget, select only one room in Atlanta (Sunny, Friendly, Brooklyn Apartment, $874/night, 2 nights = $1,748), one in Augusta ($637/night, 2 nights = $1,274), and one in Savannah ($976/night, 2 nights = $1,952). For meals, choose lower-cost options (average $20/person/meal), and consider sharing accommodations where possible. Adjustments may be needed for strict budget adherence. All selected accommodations allow smoking or do not prohibit it.
