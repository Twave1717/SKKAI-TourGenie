Thought 10: Thought 10: Thought 10: I have found a diverse list of restaurants in San Juan, including their average costs, cuisines, and ratings. I should store this restaurant information in the Notebook for use in the travel plan.
Action 10: Action 10: NotebookWrite[Restaurants in San Juan]
Observation 10: The information has been recorded in Notebook, and its index is 4.

Thought 11: Thought 11: Now that I have collected information on flights, accommodation, attractions, and restaurants in San Juan, I should also consider local transportation options between the airport and the hotel, as well as within the city, to ensure the plan is comprehensive and fits the budget.
Action 11: Action 11: GoogleDistanceMatrix[San Juan Airport, San Juan City Center, taxi]
Observation 11: taxi, from San Juan Airport to San Juan City Center, no valid information.

Thought 12: Thought 12: Since there is no valid taxi information from San Juan Airport to the city center, I should try searching for self-driving (car rental) options to provide an alternative for local transportation.
Action 12: Action 12: GoogleDistanceMatrix[San Juan Airport, San Juan City Center, self-driving]
Observation 12: self-driving, from San Juan Airport to San Juan City Center, no valid information.

Thought 13: Thought 13: Since I was unable to retrieve valid transportation information for both taxi and self-driving options from San Juan Airport to the city center, I have already gathered sufficient information on flights, accommodation, attractions, and restaurants. I can now proceed to input all the collected data into the Planner tool to generate a detailed 3-day travel plan within the specified budget.
