[Grounded Persona Reference Cards]
The following JSON array contains preference cards sampled/retrieved from a public travel-preference dataset.
Use them ONLY as inspiration for realistic, diverse preferences (do not copy IDs; do not claim they are the same person).

{persona_references_json}

[Your output requirements]
Create exactly N personas where N = initial_info.people_number.

For EACH persona:
- name: short Korean given name (2~3 syllables) or simple English first name (unique across personas)
- role: their discussion role (e.g., budget, food, logistics, comfort, culture, outdoor, etc.)
- archetype: choose one of the allowed archetypes (must match the role)
- profile:
  - profile_text: EXACTLY 1 sentence (no line breaks)
  - age_range: choose one
  - season: MUST match the trip season inferred from initial_info.date
  - budget_tier: choose a RELATIVE tier from [Frugal, Budget, Comfort, Luxury] (mix tiers across group for realistic negotiation)
  - experiences: 1~4 items (diverse across group)
  - scenery: 1~4 items (diverse across group)
  - activity_level / safety_conscious / destination_popularity: keep consistent with experiences + age_range
- budget_profile.max_budget_multiplier:
  - choose a value in [0.7, 1.4]
  - lower if budget_tier is lower; higher if budget_tier is higher
- grounding_anchors:
  - DO NOT invent anchors
  - will be overwritten by the system, but still provide 2~4 anchors based on initial_info (destination, dates, group size, budget)
- seed_preferences:
  - 3~5 short bullet-like strings (no numbering), describing personal preferences that could later become constraints
  - MUST be general and closed-world compatible (no requiring external live search)

IMPORTANT:
- Do NOT include any structured_requirement in Stage 1.
- Do NOT include any extra top-level keys besides: source_id, initial_info, group_personas.
