Below is a multi-persona travel scenario. For each persona, produce DB-groundable constraints.

[DB Schema Block]
{schema_block}

[DB Snapshot (optional hints)]
{snapshot_block}

[Initial Info]
{initial_info_json}

[Group Personas (compact)]
{personas_json}

Task
For each persona_index i (0..N-1), output:
- structured_requirement.hard_constraints: 2~6 items
- structured_requirement.soft_constraints: 2~10 items

Guidelines
- Maximize diversity across personas and within each persona (use different fields and operators).
- Prefer constraints that are plausibly satisfiable given the snapshot (if provided), but you may
  still propose creative keyword-based proxies even if not guaranteed.
- Keep thresholds realistic and unit-consistent:
  - accommodation.price is per-night per listing (not total budget)
  - flight.price is one-way per person
  - restaurant.avg_cost is per-person per meal
- Use `between` rather than duplicating two constraints (>= and <=) when you are expressing a range.
- Provide `description` (1 sentence) for EVERY constraint, because Stage3 uses it as the main natural-language handle.
- Use DISCRETE alpha levels (see system rubric) and set beta ≈ 1 - alpha.

Return ONLY the JSON object.
